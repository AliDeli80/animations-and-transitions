## Project Overview  

In this project, I have created a visually appealing animation that captures a horse running across a desert scene. The focus is on utilizing CSS animations and transitions to bring the scene to life, illustrating how CSS can be used for creative effects beyond simple styling.  

## Features  

- **CSS Animations**: Smooth animations for the horse's movement.  
- **Transitions**: Interactive elements that enhance the user experience.  
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adaptations for various screen sizes.  
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works well in modern web browsers.

## Getting Started  

To get started with this project, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/AliDeli80/animations-and-transitions.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**: Open index.html in your web browser to view the animation.

3. **Explore the code**: Check out the style.css file to see the CSS animations and transitions in action.

## How It Works

The project utilizes keyframe animations to create the running effect of the horse. Additionally, transitions are implemented for smoother interactions.

- Keyframe Animations: Defined in style.css using @keyframes.
- CSS Properties Used: transform, animation, transition, etc.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the animation! You can change the speed, direction, or even add more elements to the scene. Here are a few ideas:

- Alter the background color to represent different times of day.
- Add additional animals or objects in the desert.
- Experiment with different animation timings.
